# credit-risk-classification

## Instructions

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

  * Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

  * Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

  * Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

  * Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:

1. Read the `lending_data.csv` data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Create the labels set (`y`) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (`X`) DataFrame from the remaining columns.

3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:

1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).

2. Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (`X_test`) and the fitted model.

3. Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
    * Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
    
    * Generate a confusion matrix.

    * Print the classification report.

4. Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

##  Overview of Analysis
* Purpose: Create a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers
* Resources: csv data set that included historical lending activity from a lending services company
* Dependent Variable: (y value) - "loan status". Shows whether a loan is healthy or high-risk (0-1).
